/// itself implements `ReadOnlyTier` and every time a claim is processed it
/// logs the block number of the claim against every tier claimed. So the block
/// numbers in the tier report for `FlowERC20` are the last time that tier
/// was claimed against this contract. The simplest way to make use of this
/// information is to take the max block for the underlying tier and the last
/// claim and then diff it against the current block number.
/// See `test/Claim/FlowERC20.sol.ts` for examples, including providing
/// staggered rewards where more tokens are minted for higher tier accounts.
